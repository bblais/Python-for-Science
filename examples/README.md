## Author: Brian Blais


## Installation

Here are the steps for installation of the packages needed for using Python for Science.  The order of installation is important, so please read carefully.  In the Installation folder there are a few installation files.  Run them in this order:

### Windows 
1. *npp.6.3.1.Installer.exe*
2. *anaconda-1.8.0-Windows-x86.exe*
    When you install this, you should make sure that anaconda is installed as your system python, as in this screenshot:

3. *pymc-2.3.win32-py27.exe*
4. *update_all.bat*


### Mac 
1. *TextWrangler_4.5.5.dmg*
2. *Anaconda-1.8.0-MacOSX-x86_64.pkg*
3. *update_all.bat*



If all goes well, you'll have everything set up.
